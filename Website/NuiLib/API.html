API documentation is available in two forms. 

1. The <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~johnmcc/Documentation/">simple<a> API only has the documentation for <i><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~johnmcc/Documentation/_nui_lib-_a_p_i_8h_source.html">&lt;NuiLib-API.h&gt;</a></i>. This is the basic API that can be used to use the libraries to integrate NUI functionality into your application. It is fairly thoroughly documented. 
2. The <a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~johnmcc/Documentation-Full/">full</a> API is the entire library. It includes all the classes which actually implement the functionality exposed by <i><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~johnmcc/Documentation/_nui_lib-_a_p_i_8h_source.html">&lt;NuiLib-API.h&gt;</a></i>. It is only useful if you are extending the library. The base classes for extension are semi documented. The rest of the code is less clear. This documentation will give you a feel for how the library is put together.
